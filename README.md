# Natural Language Processing: Words Highlights

This is a footage of research on Natural Language Processing using Huggingface and PyTorch libraries. 
The research was conducted from July - August 2021 under the supervision of [Dr. Kenneth Arnold](https://calvin.edu/directory/people/kenneth-arnold) at [Calvin University](https://calvin.edu/).


The purpose of this research was to help language teachers to see texts from thier student's view. I created a model, which highlights the input words based on the difficulty in the context.
